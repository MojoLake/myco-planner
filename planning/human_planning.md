- Instead of LLM, use a deterministic formula for priority ordering. For this we need the deadlines and an estimate from the LLM on how long the task takes.
- We need to think about the CUJ:
- is this a web app? How would that work?

  - They would need to input the cookie
  - but they would also need to install a local LLM assuming they are not comfortable sending cookie data over internet (which is a valid assumption)

- So:
  - show today's tasks (prioritisation algo)
  - next 3 days
  - next week
  - next month?
